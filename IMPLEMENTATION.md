# memmy — Implementation Checklist

Working list of what we're building. Source-of-truth for design lives in `DESIGN.md`. Conventions in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Round 1 — v1 implementation (commits 81353df, 46c3359)

### US-001 — Project scaffold ✅
- [x] `go.mod` for Go 1.26.2 (module `github.com/Cidan/memmy`)
- [x] Directory layout: `cmd/memmy/`, `internal/{chunker,clock,config,embed,embed/fake,embed/gemini,graph,service,storage/bbolt,transport/mcp,types,vectorindex}`
- [x] `IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` references this file
- [x] `.omc/prd.json` with task-specific stories
- [x] `go build ./...` succeeds

### US-002 — Core types (`internal/types/`) ✅
- [x] `Node`, `Message`, `MemoryEdge` (with `EdgeKind` constants), `HNSWRecord`, `HNSWMeta`, `TenantInfo`
- [x] `WriteRequest/Result`, `RecallRequest/Result`, `ForgetRequest/Result`, `StatsRequest/Result`, `RecallHit`, `ScoreBreakdown`
- [x] `TenantID` derivation: normalize tuple → sha256-truncated hex
- [x] Test: tenant-id determinism + canonicalization

### US-003 — Clock (`internal/clock/`) ✅
- [x] `Clock` interface with `Now() time.Time`
- [x] `Real` impl
- [x] `Fake` impl with `Advance(dur)` and `Set(t)`

### US-004 — Graph interface (`internal/graph/`) + bbolt impl (`internal/storage/bbolt/graph.go`) ✅
- [x] `Graph` interface per DESIGN.md §9.2
- [x] bbolt impl: nested buckets per DESIGN.md §4.7
- [x] Both `eout/` and `ein/` mirrors written atomically in one tx
- [x] `UpdateNode`/`UpdateEdge` closure API
- [x] Tombstone semantics on Node
- [x] Real bbolt integration tests in `t.TempDir()`:
  - CRUD for Node/Message/Edge
  - Bidirectional neighbor lookup
  - Atomic dual-mirror edge updates
  - Aborted tx leaves consistent state

### US-005 — VectorIndex interface (`internal/vectorindex/`) + bbolt flat scan (`internal/storage/bbolt/vectorindex.go`) ✅
- [x] `VectorIndex` interface per DESIGN.md §9.2
- [x] Vector L2 normalization helper
- [x] Raw little-endian float32 serialization
- [x] Flat scan via bbolt cursor (streaming, bounded heap)
- [x] Real bbolt integration test: flat scan returns correct top-N for known vectors

### US-006 — HNSW algorithm (in `internal/storage/bbolt/hnsw.go`) ✅
- [x] HNSW insert: greedy descent + ef-search + neighbor selection + bidirectional pruning, all in one tx
- [x] HNSW search: greedy descent + ef-search at layer 0
- [x] Hard delete via `Delete()` repairs neighbor lists across all layers; updates entry point
- [x] Backend selection: flat scan < threshold else HNSW
- [x] HNSW oracle integration test: HNSW agrees with flat scan above the recall@k floor (see Round 2 US-101 — currently 0.95)
- [x] Tx-abort consistency test (Update + Delete failure paths)

### US-007 — Embedder (`internal/embed/`) ✅
- [x] `Embedder` interface
- [x] Fake impl: deterministic hash-to-vector (SHA-256 → []float32)
- [x] Gemini impl: real `google.golang.org/genai` client; `GEMINI_API_KEY` from env
- [x] Tests: fake determinism; Gemini live test gated behind `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### US-008 — Chunker (`internal/chunker/`) ✅
- [x] Sentence splitter (rule-based, with abbreviation list and initial detection)
- [x] Sliding window (size=3, stride=2) per DESIGN.md §4.1
- [x] Tests: 10-sentence example produces `[1,2,3], [3,4,5], [5,6,7], [7,8,9], [9,10]`; idempotence; trailing-window correctness

### US-009 — MemoryService Write (`internal/service/`) ✅
- [x] `Write` op: chunk → embed (batched, before tx) → normalize → for each window: persist Node + vector + HNSW insert; structural edges (sequential within message + recent within tenant)
- [x] Integration test (real bbolt + fake embedder): writing a 10-sentence message creates 5 nodes, 5 vectors, 5 HNSW records, sequential edges between adjacent chunks

### US-010 — MemoryService Recall ✅
- [x] Vector search (flat or HNSW per tenant size) with oversample
- [x] Weight-aware rerank by `sim_normalized^α × weight^β`
- [x] Hebbian co-retrieval edge updates between seed pairs
- [x] BFS expansion via memory edges with edge-floor pruning + depth penalty
- [x] Co-traversal reinforcement on edges that delivered nodes into final result set
- [x] Provenance returned (score breakdown + path)
- [x] Integration tests:
  - Hot memory ranks above stale memory of equal raw similarity
  - Co-retrieval edges form between two memories returned together
  - Memory reachable only via expansion is included in result set
  - Edge whose decayed weight falls below `edge_floor` is removed on its next access

### US-011 — MemoryService Forget + Stats ✅
- [x] `Forget` by `MessageID` (purge all chunks + vectors + HNSW records + adjacent edges)
- [x] `Forget` by `Before` timestamp (purge messages and derived data created before)
- [x] `Stats` aggregates per-tenant or globally (initially via bucket walk; later O(1) — see Round 2 US-102)
- [x] Integration tests for both

### US-012 — Lazy decay/reinforce contract ✅
- [x] Decay+reinforce closure runs inside a single backend tx (`Graph.UpdateNode`/`UpdateEdge`)
- [x] Edge with decayed weight below `edge_floor` is deleted (both mirrors) inside the same access tx
- [x] Tests using `clock.Fake` cover decay over time and reinforcement caps

### US-013 — Configuration (`internal/config/`) ✅
- [x] YAML loader matching DESIGN.md §12 schema
- [x] Validation; env-var resolution for API keys
- [x] Tests for happy path + missing required fields
- [x] Sample config at `memmy.example.yaml`

### US-014 — MCP transport adapter (`internal/transport/mcp/`) ✅
- [x] Server using `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` v1.5.0
- [x] Tools: `memory.write`, `memory.recall`, `memory.forget`, `memory.stats`
- [x] Streamable HTTP handler exposed via `Adapter.HTTPHandler()`
- [x] Integration tests: in-process MCP client invokes each tool against a real bbolt-backed service and verifies the result

### US-015 — Entrypoint and supervisor ✅
- [x] `cmd/memmy/main.go` loads config, constructs Embedder/VectorIndex/Graph/MemoryService, registers transports, runs them under a suture supervisor
- [x] Signal-driven graceful shutdown closes the storage backend
- [x] `go build ./cmd/memmy` succeeds; smoke-tested end-to-end (HTTP 200 on `initialize`, clean SIGTERM shutdown)

### US-016 — Final regression ✅
- [x] `go vet ./...` clean
- [x] `go build ./...` clean
- [x] `go test ./...` all green
- [x] `go test -race ./...` all green

## Round 2 — Polish (commits ceca0fe, d0bd2ca)

Architect-flagged improvements applied without changing the architectural envelope.

### US-101 — Full Malkov §4 Algorithm 4 neighbor heuristic ✅
- [x] `selectNeighborsHeuristic` admits `c` to `R` only when `dist(c, q) < dist(c, r)` for every already-chosen `r`; rejects fall to a discarded set; `keepPrunedConnections=true` fills remaining slots from discarded
- [x] `candidate` carries an optional `vec []float32` so pairwise distances are computed without re-reading vectors
- [x] `searchLayerTx` and `linkAndPruneTx` populate `vec` on every candidate
- [x] HNSW oracle test recall floor raised **0.93 → 0.95** and met (k=8, oversample=200, 50 queries on a 2000×32-dim corpus)

### US-102 — O(1) per-tenant counters backing Stats ✅
- [x] New collection `tenant_counters` (DESIGN.md §4.6) at `t/<tenantID>/counters/v` storing `{NodeCount, EdgeCount, SumNodeWeight, SumEdgeWeight}`
- [x] Maintained transactionally by every Graph mutation: `PutNode`/`UpdateNode`/`DeleteNode` and `PutEdge`/`UpdateEdge`/`DeleteEdge` — upsert detection captures old-weight delta; brand-new paths increment the count
- [x] `TenantStats` reads the counter record in O(1); no longer walks the edges bucket
- [x] `TestCounters_MatchBruteForce` exercises 400 randomized ops (insert/upsert/weight-bump/delete) and reconciles three views: shadow ↔ direct bbolt walk ↔ counter record
- [x] `TestCounters_DeleteNonexistent` guards no-op deletes against drift

### US-103 — Recall candidate map ✅
- [x] `Service.Recall` builds `map[string]candidate` once before the visit-scoring loop; per-visit lookup is O(1) instead of O(seeds)

### US-104 — README ✅
- [x] `README.md` orients new readers (stack, load-bearing principle, links to DESIGN/CLAUDE/IMPLEMENTATION, build & run pointer)

### US-105 — Final regression ✅
- [x] `go vet ./...` clean
- [x] `go build ./...` clean
- [x] `go test ./...` all green (**64 tests across 13 packages**)
- [x] `go test -race ./...` all green

## Round 3 — MCP stdio transport

### US-201 — MCP stdio adapter ✅
- [x] Same tool surface as the streamable HTTP transport (no schema divergence)
- [x] `Adapter.RunStdio(ctx)` blocks on `Server.Run` against `mcpsdk.StdioTransport{}`
- [x] `Adapter.RunTransport(ctx, t)` exposed for tests; the integration test wires the same tool surface through `mcpsdk.NewInMemoryTransports` and round-trips `memory.write`

### US-202 — Config: stdio mutually exclusive with all other transports ✅
- [x] `internal/config` recognizes a `stdio` transport (Enabled=true, no Addr)
- [x] `Config.Validate` rejects stdio + any other enabled transport, naming both
- [x] Stdio-only validates without Addr; HTTP transports still require Addr
- [x] Tests cover every combination: stdio-only accepted; stdio + mcp/grpc/http rejected; stdio + disabled-other accepted

### US-203 — Wire stdio into entrypoint ✅
- [x] `cmd/memmy/main.go` branches on configured transport: stdio runs `Adapter.RunStdio` directly; HTTP runs under suture
- [x] Logs always written to stderr — stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC frames
- [x] Signal-driven graceful shutdown still works (ctx cancel propagates through `Server.Run`)
- [x] Smoke test: `printf '<initialize JSON-RPC>\n' | ./memmy --config stdio.yaml` returns a valid initialize response on stdout, then EOF on stdin yields exit 0

### US-204 — Documentation ✅
- [x] DESIGN.md §10.2 describes both HTTP and stdio variants with the mutual-exclusivity rule and rationale
- [x] DESIGN.md §12 sample config includes the new `stdio` key
- [x] `memmy.example.yaml` shows both options with comments
- [x] `README.md` mentions stdio
- [x] This file: Round 3 documented

### US-205 — Final regression ✅
- [x] `go vet ./...` clean
- [x] `go build ./...` clean
- [x] `go test ./...` all green
- [x] `go test -race ./...` all green
